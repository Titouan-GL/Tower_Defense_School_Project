# Tower Defence
this project was realized during my school years when I was 15. It used to be finished but I lost some files so it's not anymore.

## how to launch

execute the TD.py file with the command 
```python3 TD.py```

## how to play

Build turrets in the right spot in order to defend against enemies attacking the mortar in the center.
-The sniper turret can attack flying units with long range but low attack speed
-The farm can earn you money
-the rifle turret has high attack speed but low attack power and range.

You can upgrade or destroy every turret

you can place walls or soldiers in order to protect you from ennemies, these do not cost any money but have a cooldown.

## additionnal info
every graphic file is included in sprites but the latest version of the python file was lost so they are not all included
